# Spam Ham Classifier

Nowadays, most people have access to the Internet, and they cannot survive without Smartphone and computers. They not only use the Internet for fun and entertainment, but they also use it for business, stock marketing, searching, sending e-mails, and so on. Hence, the usage of the Internet is growing rapidly. 

One of the threats for such technology is a spam. Spam has a lot of definitions, as it is considered one of the complex problems in e-mail services. Spam is a junk mail/message, or an unsolicited mail/message. Spam e-mails are also those unwanted, unsolicited e-mails that are not intended for a specific receiver. It is basically an online communication sent to the user without permission. It takes on various forms like adult content, selling products or services, job offers, and so forth. The spam has increased tremendously in the last few years.
 
The good, perfect, and official mails are known as ham. It is also defined as an e-mail that is generally desired.
Today, more than 85% of mails or messages received by users are spam. It costs the sender very little time to send, but most of the costs are paid by the recipient or the service providers rather than by the sender. 

The cost of spam can also be measured in lost human time, lost server time and loss of valuable
mail/messages. The sent mail reserves a quota in the server, and the receiver may have a limited space, causing the server to reject another ham mail because it is out of space. Moreover, the reader may lose a lot of time
in reading unuseful messages. 

The Machine Learning field has a robust, ready-made and alternative way for solving this type of the problem.
We have used the power of Machine Learning and built a classifier, which helping us to classify which message is/are spam or ham depending upon their content.
